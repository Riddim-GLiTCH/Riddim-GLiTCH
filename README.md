# Riddim GLiTCH
I'm Riddim, or Lucinnnia, or Lucy, or Nia....whatever, names are weird. I'm someone on the internet who is invested in code stuff.

### What do I do?
short answer: yes.

long answer: I am very sporadic, and tend to jump from project to project. Additionally, I am learning lots of new things as we speak. My main goal is to master [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), And eventually settle my work in a more stable field. I'd like to eventually become a mod developer.

### What gender are you?
Male? Female? Both? How about I wont tell you. I like trolling. But if I had to answer, none. I couldn't decide on what I wanted to be, or wether I was comfortable with who I am now. So, for all intents and purposes, I am nonbinary.
Look, if you have an issue with LGBTQIA+. Get the fuck off my profile.

### Relationship status?
Taken. Happily so.
